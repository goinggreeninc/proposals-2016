# Northeast Scala Symposium 2016: Talk proposals

[NE Scala](http://nescala.org) does not select speakers:
you do.

Talks are proposed by you and your peers. Later, we will open up
voting for you to select the talks you want to see.

## Proposals are now closed

* **proposals due:** January 15 @ 11:59pm
* **day 1 tickets go on sale:** January 16 @ noon (at [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/nescala/events/227877388/))
* **voting opens:** January 18, if not sooner
* **voting closes:** January 25 @ 11:59pm
* **winners announced:** January 27
* **day 1 talks:** March 4
* **day 2 unconference:** March 5

times are Philadelphia time (Eastern Standard)

## Talk lengths

The following number of talks will be selected by voting:

* 3 long (45 minutes each)
* 4 medium (30 minutes each)
* 4 lightning (15 minutes each)

The timings include time for audience questions, if the speaker chooses to
leave time for them.

## FAQ

* Q: **If my talk gets voted in, am I guaranteed a ticket?**  
A: Yes, but you still have to pay the $60. (Even conference organizers pay. We're all in this together.)

* Q: **If my talk isn't voted in, can I still give it at the day 2 unconference?**  
A: Of course. Yes, please!

* Q: **Is it a good idea to submit multiple proposals?**  
A: That's hard to say. At most one of your proposals can get in.
And there is a danger of splitting your votes. On the other hand,
when we tally the votes, we'll informally take vote-splitting
partially into account; we don't want to lose a popular speaker
just because of equally-split votes.

* Q: **Will videos of the talks be published?**  
A: Yes (unless the speaker objects). Day 1 only, though.

Have a different question?
[Open an issue](https://github.com/nescalas/proposals-2016/issues) and
an organizer will answer.  (You can also ask questions in your pull request.)

## How to submit a talk (CLOSED)

In this repository, submit a pull request adding a file to the
[`proposals` directory](https://github.com/nescalas/proposals-2016/tree/master/proposals) with the basics on your talk, including
a one-paragraph summary.

For "length", specify either 45 minutes (long), 30 minutes (medium), or 15 minutes (lightning).

### Formatting

* Use Markdown format
* Copy the [sample proposal](https://github.com/nescalas/proposals-2016/blob/master/proposals/sample-proposal.md)
* For more samples, see [last year's proposals](http://www.nescala.org/2015/talks#proposals)
* Multiple proposals go in separate files
* Filename doesn't really matter, but if you want a suggestion: `lastname--name-of-the-talk.md`
* Ensure that the filename has extension `.md` or `.markdown`, please.
* Don't worry too much about exact formatting; we'll figure it out
